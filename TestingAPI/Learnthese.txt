-------- API --------------

API:
APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other
using a set of definitions and protocols.
- API stands for Application Programming Interface.
- API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.

Types
- SOAP APIs (Simple Object Access Protocol)
	 Client and server exchange messages using XML.
	 This is a less flexible API that was more popular in the past.

- RPC APIs (Remote Procedure Calls)
	 The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server,
	 and the server sends the output back to the client.

- Websocket APIs

- REST APIs
